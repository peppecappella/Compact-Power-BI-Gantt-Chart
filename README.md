# Compact Gantt Chart for Power BI

## Description

This project provides a customized Gantt Chart visualization for Power BI. It is a variation of the original version by David Bacci, available on GitHub, with a key difference in how subactivities are displayed. In this version, all subactivities of the same task are represented on the same row. This approach minimizes vertical space usage and keeps related data grouped, making it easier for users to quickly compare overlapping subactivities within a single timeline. This is intended as an alternative way of visualizing Gantt data, offering a different perspective while building upon the excellent foundation of the original work.

## Usage

Once you open the .pbix file, you can view and interact with your Gantt Chart data within Power BI.
